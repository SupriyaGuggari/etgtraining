1. Create a file which contains long listing of the files in root directory
   ls -l / >file1

2.Sort the file based on the filename descending order 
  sort -d | sort -r

3. Sort the file based only on the inode count
   ls -i | sort -n

4. Sort the file based on the user name and group name in reverse order
   ls -l >file1 |sort -d file1 | sort -r file1

5. Sort the file based on the file size and store the output in a file called sortedfile
    ls -l >file1 |sort -n [-o sortedfile] file1
