   The basic calculator, bc, can do calculations to any precision that you specify. 
   Therefore, if you know how to calculate pi and want to know its value to 20, 50, or 200 places,    
   for example, use bc. 
   This tool can add, subtract, multiply, divide, and raise a number to a power. It can take square 
   roots, compute sines and cosines of angles, calculate exponentials and 
   logarithms, and handle arctangents and Bessel functions
